# Basic-Python-Program-Under-Edge-Program
I am Arpita Purkayastha,currently studying in final year in the Department of Physics at Shahjalal University of Science and Technology.
I have successfully completed the "Introduction to Basic Python Programming" course under the Edge Program, which can be considered my first step into learning Python programming. Offering such a project for free provides an excellent opportunity for students like me who are eager to learn coding but lack proper guidance. I made sure to utilize the opportunity and benefit from this initiative.
Therefore, I extend my best wishes to everyone associated with the Edge Project and I request them to organize more such initiatives to equip the young generation with digital skills. Notably, the instructor who conducted our course worked tirelessly to make our learning journey smoother. Also,the instructor's dedication towards this course has helped me in understanding the core concepts of Python.I am sincerely grateful to him for putting in so much effort to present Python in a simpler manner, especially for non-IT students like me!!
